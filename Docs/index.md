TwometerVR is a project intended for people who have a virtual reality headset such as the Oculus DK2, that have no hand trackers/controllers to go along with it. It provides an open-source alternative to expensive commercial devices such as PS Move or the official Oculus Touch trackers. Currently, TwometerVR works with SteamVR and Windows.



Here, you can find technical documentation about how the trackers can be built, programmed and extended.
