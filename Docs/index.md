# Welcome

TwometerVR is an open-source alternative to commercial VR hand/body tracking systems.

It's primarily intended for those who have VR headsets such as the Oculus DK2 that don't include controllers. It is a low-cost alternative to expensive commercial devices such as the PS Move or Oculus Touch system.

## Features

- 3D hand tracking controllers with 7 buttons and 9-DoF IMUs
- Works with BeatSaber, VRChat, or any other SteamVR game
- Low-cost with around $15 per controller
- Fully open-source and open-hardware

Although there is currently no implementation of full-body-tracking, the system is technically fully capable of supporting it.

## Getting started

As this is currently a hobby project of mine, there are no ready-made products or kits available for purchase.

To learn about the way the system works, check out the [system structure page](/Basics/System structure). If you're interested in the hardware, you can find all the required 3D models and PCB layouts on the [hardware page](Hardware/). The source code is available in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Twometer/twometer-vr).
