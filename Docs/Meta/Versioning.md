# Versioning

- TwometerVR uses sematic versioning, that means MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- The new version will be a complete rewrite/rebuild of the TVR system, therefore it's 2.0.0

- Some subprojects have wrong or unassigned version numbers. With the next TVR, every subproject will have the same MAJOR version. However, each one may have different MINOR and PATCH parts.

  TVR 2.0.0 resets everything to 2.0.0
