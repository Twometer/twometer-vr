# Versioning

TwometerVR uses sematic versioning, that means `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g. `2.4.9`)

Prior to version 2, Some subprojects had wrong or unassigned version numbers. Now, every subproject has the same MAJOR version. However, each one may have different MINOR and PATCH parts.

> For consistency's sake, the version 2 rewrite reset the version of all subprojects back to 2.0.0
